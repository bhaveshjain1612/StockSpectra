## Features

The Financial Dashboard comes equipped with several features to help you navigate the stock market effectively:

### 1. Stock Screening

The "Stock Screening" section allows you to filter and view stocks based on various criteria, making it easy to find stocks that meet your specific preferences.

- **Filter by Stock Name**: Enter a partial or full name of the stock you are interested in, and the dashboard will filter the relevant results accordingly.
- **Filter by Stock Exchange**: Select the desired stock exchange (NSE or BSE) from the dropdown menu. The dashboard will display stocks from the selected exchange.
- **Filter by Stock Rank (Outlook)**: Choose one or more stock ranks (e.g., positive, negative, neutral) to filter stocks based on their outlook. The dashboard will update with the selected stocks.
- **Filter by Financial Rank**: Similar to stock rank, you can filter stocks based on their financial rank (e.g., strong, weak). Choose one or more financial ranks to apply the filter.
- **View Options**: Choose from three viewing options:
  - **Top Picks**: Displays the top-rated stocks with strong outlook and financials.
  - **All**: Shows all stocks based on applied filters.
  - **Potential Breakout**: Lists stocks that are potential breakout candidates (requires CSV file "backend_data/breakout.csv").
- **Filter by Sector and Industry**: Further refine your search by selecting specific sectors and industries. Use the multiselect dropdowns to include or exclude particular sectors/industries.
- **Display Companies**: Adjust the number of companies you want to display using the slider. You can view a maximum of 10 companies at once.

### 2. In-Depth Stock Analysis

The "In-Depth Stock Analysis" section allows you to explore detailed insights for individual stocks.

- **Enter Stock Ticker**: Input the stock ticker in the sidebar using the text input box, and press Enter. The app will display insights for the specified company.
- **Share Insights via URL**: The app supports loading insights based on the stock ticker passed through the URL query parameters. Share specific company insights with others by providing the stock ticker in the URL.

#### Tabs for Comprehensive Analysis

- **Firmo Tab**: Displays firmographic data about the company, including its sector, industry, and a brief description. A holding chart provides graphical representation related to the company's holdings.

Interactive charts allow customization options like different Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) and Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), Bollinger Bands, time intervals, and additional indicators.
- **Financial Tab**: Provides financial metrics such as Net Income, Debt, Free Cash Flow, Basic EPS, Net Profit Margin, ROA, ROE, ROCE, Current Ratio, and DE Ratio. Desirable and non-desirable indicators are listed, and detailed financial data is accessible for the company.
