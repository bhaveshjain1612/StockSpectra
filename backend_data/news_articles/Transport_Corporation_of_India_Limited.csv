With the Government of India’s aim to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2070, E-Mobility India Forum, organised by Messe Frankfurt India, strives to achieve these commitments with the help of industry experts.

By bringing together policymakers, automotive OEMs, battery makers, charging technology and charging infrastructure developers, EV start-ups and power storage companies on one platform, the show will shed light on the issues, challenges and resistance currently faced by this industry and will also discuss the emerging trends, innovations in electric vehicles, battery and charging technologies.

To be held on August 17 and 18, 2023, the forum caters to the interest of visitors from various segments such as electric vehicle manufacturers, electric vehicle component manufacturers, battery manufacturers, charging technology manufacturers, charging infrastructure developers, charging service providers, energy distribution companies, EV start-ups, testing and certification agencies, fleet owners, e-commerce companies, auto part makers, automobile dealers, mobility researchers, environment evangelists, sustainability experts or battery recyclers, policy makers and regulators and many more.

Acknowledging the third edition of E-Mobility India Forum, Raj Manek, Executive Director and Board Member, Messe Frankfurt Asia, noted that E-Mobility presents a unique opportunity for progress. It will not only provide smarter infrastructure but will also reduce costs, expand economic activity and protect the planet.

With the world now in the middle of a new mobility revolution, it is imperative to understand E-mobility on a wider forum. And, with an ever-growing manufacturing base in India, this new revelation will provide millions of educated minds and skilled hands, an aspirational dream to power up the nation's future, he added.

Eminent speakers from various sectors, companies and geographies of India will attend this event to put forward new conclusions, perspectives, and ideas on the theme. Bringing fresh ideas and insights from the industry on the topic, the discussion panel will host 40+ distinguished and prominent speakers who are industry experts from the ministry and C-suite executives from various well-known companies. Some of them include General (Dr) V K Singh, Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways and Civil Aviation, Dr Hanif Qureshi, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Heavy Industries, Shekhar Channe, Vice Chairman and MD, Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation, Sudhendu J Sinha, Adviser (Infrastructure Connectivity & Electric Mobility), NITI Aayog, Dr T Surya Kiran, Executive Director, The Association of State Road Transport Undertakings and Mahesh Babu, CEO, Switch Mobility.
